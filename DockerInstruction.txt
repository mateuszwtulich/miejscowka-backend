Setup for ruining docker from backend folder


Precondition : 
Install docker from https://hub.docker.com for windows 10. For another win OS install also docker toolbox.
set folders as "context" described in docker-compose.yml or change context values to match your folders.

Setup docker containers :
1. Build project "docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" build"
2. Start compose containers from file "docker-compose.yml" (defaulty in backend dir) with command "docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up"

backend localhost:8090 
frontend-localhost:4200 
occupancy-simulator-micoservice localhost:8050
occupancy-receiver-micoservice localhost:8060 
occupancy-modeling-micoservice localhost:8070
postgres localhost:5050
(ports are mapped from docker network in compose file)

To turn off compose run (docker-compose down)
Then to delete docker image (docker rmi name_of_image)
To run individual container from image (docker run -p 4200:80 miejscowka_frontend)
To show all created images (docker images)
